Heroes of Might and Magic inspired game on Unity. For now, it has only basic mechanics like moving on the grid, attacking in melee, stats, retaliation, etc.
This project was created to test new ideas, architectural approaches and libraries.

Keep in mind that the game is still under development, so it might have some bugs (no way to attack from the position you are standing at and some others) and terribly written code (AI, WindowsSystem). All of the visuals were done in 2 days from random assets I had.
