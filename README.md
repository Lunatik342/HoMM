Heroes of Might and Magic inspired game on Unity, for now has it only basic mechanics like moving on the grid, attacking in melee, stats, retaliation etc.
Keep in mind that the game is still under developement, so is might have some bugs (no way to attack from position you are standing at and some others) and terribly written code (AI, WindowsSystem).
